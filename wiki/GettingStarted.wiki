#summary How to get started with monohad.
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

= Introduction =

The application is fully contained and can be used with Max5 runtime (available here: http://www.cycling74.com/downloads/max5). Please note that the comments only apply to the collective version (monohad.mxf) and not the source patches.

There is an issue with Runtime not being able to search recursively into sub directories which leads to patchers not being found.


= Details =

After you downloaded the latest zip and installed Max Runtime, it should contain the following files:

 # *monohad.mxf* --> the main application
 # */externals*  --> additional externals required
 # */MIDI*       --> MIDI mapping files

In order to get started, the following activities need to be undertaken.

 # Create LOOPS folder within Max5 application directory and put your loops there
 # Create SAMPLES folder within Max5 application directory and put your drumsequencer samples there
 # copy the externals from the externals folder (see above) to the msp-externals folder within the Cycling'74 subdirectory of your Max5 application directory
 # copy the MIDI folder (see above) from the archive to your Max5 application directory
 # Start MaxRT.exe 
 # Open application (monohad.mxf)
 # Make sure overdrive is enabled (see Edit menu)
 # Hit Esc or use mouse (master phase rectangle at the bottom) to start the DSP
 # Click into one of the channels to start or use monome (see Monome64Mapping)


On Windows, there have been consistent errors when starting the monohad.mxf directly with right-click/context menu. Therefore, I would recommend to rather start MaxRT.exe upfront as explained above.

If the application isn't working (no audio etc.), just drop me a line under post.monome.org or open an issue here --> http://code.google.com/p/monohad/issues/list
