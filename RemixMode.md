# Introduction #

monohad also supports random playback of the loops.

# Details #

By activating remix mode via the channel management page (page 99, see Monome64Mapping), random patterns can be generated. In this case, the slices are played back in random order but still beat synced to the channel tempo and the other channels.

Remix mode can be activated via mouse as well, by pressing the "Seq off" picture button underneath the fx volume faders (right hand side). The button next to it (left hand side) activates a specific step sequencer window which allows you to make further settings. The "cycle" box for instance, generates a new random pattern every time the loop has finished playing.
