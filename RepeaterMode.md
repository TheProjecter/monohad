# Introduction #

This feature is inspired by the repeater app (thx to bonanza9)

# Details #

When pressing **button 1** of **row 2** on the looper page, the repeater mode can be switched on. In this case, **button 5-7** are not used for managing patterns but rather to repeat button presses (stutter) according to the predefined repeat length.

The repeater lengths can be adjusted via the drop downs in the page window (bottom left).
